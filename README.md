# My Homelab

![Diagram homelab](https://github.com/kibk/homelab/blob/master/diagram-drawio.png?raw=true)

Self-hosted stack that I am running. Its main objective is to learn. I have a small cluster of 3 Raspberry Pis, VPS, Proxmox host and some networking equipment. Proxmox hosts OPNSense firewall and OpenMediaVault for NFS. VPS is used for all the Public traffic.

## Docker images

[linuxserver.io](https://linuxserver.io). They are the only and the best! Just checkout their [images](https://fleet.linuxserver.io/)

## Backups

[backblaze.com](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) B2 storage, they are reliable, not that expensive and they give you 10 GB of storage for free!

## VPS 

[Contabo VPS](https://contabo.com/?show=configurator&vserver_id=221): 4 CPUs, 8 GB RAM, 200 GB SDD
