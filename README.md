# My Homelab

Self-hosted stack that I am running. Its main objective is to learn. I have a small cluster of 3 Raspberry Pis, VPS, Proxmox host and some networking equipment. Proxmox hosts OPNSense firewall and OpenMediaVault for NFS. VPS is used for all the Public traffic.

# TODO
- Add subrepositories
- Make those subrepositories public =)
- Add a diagram
