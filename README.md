# My Homelab

Self-hosted stack that I am running. Its main objective is to learn. I have a small cluster of 3 Raspberry Pis, VPS, Proxmox host and some networking equipment. Proxmox hosts OPNSense firewall and OpenMediaVault for NFS. VPS is used for all the Public traffic.

## VPS 

[Contabo VPS](https://contabo.com/?show=configurator&vserver_id=221): 4 CPUs, 8 GB RAM, 200 GB SDD
